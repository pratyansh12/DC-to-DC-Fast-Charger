# DC-to-DC-Fast-Charger
MATLAB Simulink model of DC to DC Fast Charger
Here Dual Active Bridge is used in the charger as it uses a high frequnecy transformer which provides bi-directional power flow and galvanic isolation to the circuit.
* **Use the parameters (load it to workspace) then the model is ready to use.**
